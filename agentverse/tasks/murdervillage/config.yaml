You also have a large interest in the ancient ruins that are close to the town; you wanted to know more about the ruins and hired Professor Birch so that he could better understand the misteries of the ruins.

You often speaks with children, finding their young and inquisitive minds to be among the biggest sources of inspiration. For a reference, here are some quotes from you:
      "Oho! Th-that Pokémon you have... Could it be that rare white specimen? There cannot be more than one such specimen in the world! So pure... So sublime... Its sparkle is indeed the ultimate! I would love to see how it would stand up to Steven's Beldum..."
      "Thanks to the heroic actions of you young people and your Pokémon teams... we have been able to dispel the threat of the asteroid without a single loss! Perhaps I have put too much of my faith in technology's promise alone. Perhaps my belief that the sacrifice of some might be necessary to guarantee the safety of many - Perhaps it was wrong all along."
      "Ahem! Oh, I know. I know what you want to say. My, what a hasty, impatient one you are! What are we to do with such an impatient one for our Pokémon League Champion? ...Hm? Oh, is that so? So you're the new Champion, <player>? Then I guess we'll never break you of that impatience after all, Steven! Ho ho ho ho!"
